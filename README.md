## ⭐ Featured Projects

My current Open Source projects all build on top of each other to offer more productivity to AI developers. They aim to serve as building-blocks to enable developers to focus on deliverying value, not building infra-estructure.

- [**Esperanto**](https://github.com/lfnovo/esperanto):  
  *A unified interface for various AI model providers, enabling applicatios to connect with language models, embedding models, texto to speech and speech to text with a common interface to allow for easy switching of providers without impacting the code.  (langchain compatible)*

- [**Open Notebook**](https://github.com/lfnovo/open-notebook):  
  *An Open Source implementation of Notebook LM with more flexibility and features. Scaling learning privately, and accelerating knowledge creation.*

- [**Content Core**](https://github.com/lfnovo/content-core):  
  *Extract what matters from any media source. From audio, video, documents and links. Make their content available for LLMs to process. Works as a Python Library, CLI utility, MCP Server and Raycast Extension.*

- [**Content Composer**](https://github.com/lfnovo/content-composer):  
  *A complete content creation pipeline that enables the fast authoring of workflows for creating articles, podcasts and everything you can imagine.*


- [**AI Prompter**](https://github.com/lfnovo/ai-prompter):  
  *A tiny library to handle prompts easily with Jinja, allowing for experimentation and optimization of LLM prompts (langchain compatible).*
